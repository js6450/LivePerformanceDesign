            <p>For this week's Live Performance Design, I created a Lumia Light Performance for <a class="p-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6D4tFck6Y">South Club's I'm Crazy</a>. This is a song that had been stuck in my had for a while, so I decided to create visuals for this song. Since I had a pretty decent understanding of the structure of the song, I was able to quickly divide up the song into 4 scenes. Then I created visuals for each scene using p5.js and p5.soud.js. Below is the code that I used to create the visuals and the four scenes can be toggled with key pressed of number keys from 1 to 4. Note that this code was made for my own use so it does not do all the error handling that it should do and is not built with too much consideration for the user.</p>
            <p>Press mouse *ONCE* to start the song (this needed to be done to avoid having to deal with promise catching) and you can toggle through different scenes by pressing numbers 1 - 4. You can also try it out on <a class="p-link" href="http://jiwonshin.com/create/lumia/">this website</a>.</p>
